THE FLYING TIGER LINE INC., LOCKHEED SUPER CONSTELLATION 1OLOH
N 6921C, BETWEEN GUAM AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS,
MARCH 15, 1962
SYNOPSIS
On March 15, 1962, sometime efter its last position report at 1422 G.m.t.
(22 minutes past midnight, locel time), a Flying Tiger Line Inc., Lockheed
lohoH, N 6921C, operated as Military Air Transport Service Flight 739/14,
disappeared west of the position 13°14" North Latitude and 140°00' East
Longitude en route from Agana Naval Air Station, Guam, to Clark Air Force
Base, Philippine Islands.
A widespread and intensive search was initiated after the aircraft
failed to arrive eat Clark Air Force Base at 1916 G.m.t., its estimated time
of arrival. The flight was officially declared missing at 22°7 G.m.t. which
was the estimated fuel exhaustion time for the aircraft. A1l1 occupants, 96
military passengers and a crew of 11, are missing and presumed dead.
Crew members of a surface vessel witnessed what appeared to have been a
midair explosion at 1530 G.m.t., near the position and at the time estimated
by the pilot of N 6921C for his next scheduled position report.
No wreckage or debris which could be definitely associated with the
aircraft has been found.
The Board is unable to determine the probable cause of this accident
from the evidence now available.
Investigation
Flying Tiger Line (FTL) Flight 7815/13, operating as Military Air Transport
Service (MATS) Charter Flight 739/14, was a Lockheed Super Constellation, model
OH, U. S. Registry N 6921C. The flight originated at Travis Air Force Base,
Fairfield-Suisun, California, with refueling stops scheduled at Honolulu,
Wake Island, Guam, Philippine Islands, and was to terminate at Saigon, Viet-Nam.
It departed Travis Air Force Base at 0545 y on March 14, 1962, with
96 military passengers and a multiple-crew 2/ of 11 under the command of
Captain Gregory P. Thomas. The remaining crew members were: First Officer
Robert J. Wish, Second Officer Robbie J. Gayzaway, Flight Engineer George M. Nau,
Flight Engineer Clayton E. McClellan, Navigator William T. Kennedy, Navigator
Grady R. Burt, Jr., Stewardesses Shirley Bolo, Diane Hernandez, Joyce Oslaend,
and Joan Lambrose. The four stewardesses were replaced at Wake Island by
Stewardesses Patricia Wassum, Hildegarde Muller, Barbara Wamsley, and Christel
Reiter.
The loading and departure 3/ of the aircraft at Travis Air Force Base were
conducted normally and in accordance with MATS and FTL operating procedures.
I/ Ail times herein are Greenwich Mean based on the ol-hour clock.
2/ The flight crew consisted of three pilots, two flight engineers, two
navigators, and four stewardesses.
3/ The actual departure and arrival times at the en route stops are as follows:
Arrived Station Departed
14/0308 Travis AFB 14/0545
1h/1 74k Honolulu 14/2040
15/0354 Wake Island 15/0515
15/1114 Guam 15/1257

There was no maintenance required or performed on the aircraft. No cargo
was boarded other than passenger baggage which consisted of personal articles,
clothing, etc. Ninety-three of the 96 passengers were members of the U. 3S.
Army, mainly highly trained electronics and communications specialists; the
other three were members of the Armed Forces of Viet-Nem.
The military personnel had been briefed at their home stations and again
before boarding the aircraft, regarding regulations concerning materials which
are prohibited from being carried on board a MATS charter aircraft, i.e.,
lighter fluid, flashbulbs, loaded weapons, etc. As far as can be determined,
all of these regulations had been complied with. A subsequent security check
of all passengers, including the foreign nationals, was completed by the
U. S. Army Security Service. This disclosed no suspect areas.
The aircraft arrived in Honolulu at 1744 after a routine flight of about
12 hours. Minor maintenance was required on the ignition systems of engines
No. 1 (cylinder No. 18) and No. 3 (cylinder No. 6) which consisted of re-
placing several coils, leads, and plugs. At the request of the flight engineer,
a check was made of the air conditioning system. The ducting was disconnected
and the expansion turbine was checked for freedom of rotation. No discrepancy
of this system was noted and there were no reports at the two subsequent stops
that would have indicated any further difficulty.
The departure of the aircraft from Honolulu was delayed for 30 minutes
‘because of complaints by the stewardesses concerning inadequate crew rest
facilities aboard N 6921C. Board investigators interviewed the four
-4e
stewardesses who had attended the flight from San Francisco to Wake Island.
It was learned that the aircraft contained one single bunk and one double
punk forward of the passenger compartment. Under normal conditions there
are two pilots on duty in the cockpit and one off duty, with a single bunk
available for his use. The double bunk is for the use of the off-duty navi-
gator and the off-duty engineer. Additionally, there should have been two
passenger seats reserved for the use of the stewardesses during the flight.
However, on this flight there was only one seat provided, and when the air-
craft arrived in Honolulu the senior stewardess protested, After a conference
with the captain, FIL, and MATS officials, a mattress was placed on the deck
under the lower bunk for the use of the stewardesses. Access to this mattress
was through a small opening of approximately 18 by 24 inches.
The aircraft departed Honolulu at 2040 and arrived at Wake Islend at 0354
(March 15). Minor maintenance was again required to correct discrepancies
noted in the ignition systems of cylinders No. 2, No. 15, and No. 18 on the
No. 1 engine and cylinder No. 4 on the No. 3 engine. This also consisted of
replacing several coils, leads, and spark plugs. The aircraft was then serviced
and departed for Guam at 0515.
It arrived in Guam at 1114 after a routine flight of approximately six
hours. During the ground time of 1 hour and 33 minutes, the aircraft was
serviced to a total of 25,552 pounds of 115/145 octane gasoline, symmetrically
distributed in the four main and two auxiliary fuel tanks. Takeoff gross
weight was calculated to be 132,554 pounds, which was well below the maximum
allowable gross weight of 141,845 pounds, and was within the prescribed center
of gravity limits of the aircraft. There were no mechanical discrepancies re-
ported and no maintenance was required.

Preparations for the next leg of the flight were completed by the crew
in a routine manner. This included filing an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
flight plan to Clark Air Force Base, Philippine Islands, via a rhumb-line
course to Jomalig, Green Airway 9 to Antipolo, Amber Airway 1 to San Fernando,
direct to Clark Air Force Base, at a cruising altitude of 10,000 feet anda
true airspeed of 235 knots. The estimated time en route for this flight was
6 hours and 19 minutes, and the aircraft carried a total of 9 hours and 30
minutes fuel.
The en route weather forecast prepared for the flight by the U. S. Naval
Air Station, Agana, Guam, indicated generally scattered to broken cumulus clouds
with bases 1,800 to 2,500 feet with tops 7,000 to 10,000 feet; broken to over-
cast cirrus clouds, bases at 27,000 to 30,000 feet, and visibility 15 miles.
The only anticipated exception to the above conditions was over that portion of
the route from 135°00' to 129°00' East Longitudes, where conditions were expected
to be broken to overcast cumulus, bases 1,000 feet, tops 8,000 to 13,000 feets
broken to overcast altocumulus, bases near 14,000 feet, tops near 18,000 feet;
thin broken cirrus, bases 30,000 feet, and visibility 5 to 8 miles in moderate
rain showers. The freezing level was forecasted to slope from near 16,000 feet
at Guam to approximately 14,000 feet at Manila. Available inflight weather
reports from aircraft transiting the proposed flight route did not indicate
any turbulence. The forecast prepared for the flight did not anticipate any
significant turbulence at the planned cruising altitude.
The flight was issued an IFR clearance in accordance with its flight
plan and departed Guam at 1257. Shortly after takeoff, radar contact with
the aircraft was established by Guam Air Route Traffic Control Center. At
-6-
1304, N 6921C contacted Guam International Flight Service Station (IFSS) on
126.7 mes., and requested that a departure message be relayed to the FTL
offices in Burbank, California, Pan American Airways (PAA) Manila, and PAA
Hong Kong. At approximately 1325, the flight again contacted Guam IFSS and
requested a change in cruising altitude from 10,000 feet to 18,000 feet.
The pilot did not give any reason for this request. He was advised to contact
Guam Center on 118.5 mcs. Upon contacting Guam Center the flight was authorized
to climb to and maintain 18,000 feet. At 1328, N 6921C advised Guam Center
of climbing through 11,000 feet and estimated position 140°00' East Longitude
at 1421. At this time Guam Center advised the flight that it was 100 miles
west of Guam and that radar services were being terminated. At 1333 the flight
reported to Guam IFSS on 126.7 mcs., advised them of its position 100 miles
out at an altitude of 18,000 feet and repeated the 140°00' East Longitude
estimate. This report was acknowledged by Guam IFSS, and the flight was then
assigned the primary en route frequency of 8862.5 kes. and a secondary fre-
quency of 2966 kes.
At 1422 the flight contacted Guam IFSS on 8862.5 kcs. and reported being
at position 13°40' North and 140°00' East at 1416, cruising at 18,000 feet on
top, and estimated position 14°00' North, 135°00' East at 1530. It further
estimated Clark Air Force Base at 1916 and stated that it had 8 hours and
12 minutes of fuel remaining. This was the last radio transmission received
from N 6921C. No indication of any difficulty was given in this or any of the
Previous messages.
-T-
At 1533, Guam IFSS was experiencing communication difficulties caused
by heavy radio static while copying the 140°00’ East Longitude position of
U. S. Overseas Flight 400 which was en route from Guam to Okinawa. At 1539,
after completing this redio contact, the operator attempted to contact N 6921C
to obtain its 1530 position report. Despite numerous attempts, radio contact
could not be established. At 1600, Guam Center declared the flight to be in
uncertainty phase (INCERFA) status. At 1633 the flight was placed in alert
phase (ALERFA) status, and at 1943 it was changed to distress phase (DETRESFA)
status. Continuous attempts by all stations and aircraft in the area to con-
tact the flight were unsuccessful.
Search and rescue operations were instituted at 1943 by the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center, Agana Naval Air Station, Guam, in conjunction with Clark
Joint Air Rescue Center, Clark Air Force Base, Philippine Islands. At 2227,
the aircraft's fuel exhaustion time, Flight 739/14 was officially declered lost.
At 2105, on March 15, 1962, a message was received by Mackay Radio in
Manile from the S/S T. L. Lenzen, a super tanker owned by Standard Oil of
California, under Liberian registration, and manned by an Italian crew. The
message stated that at 1530 (1-1/2 hours past midnight, local time) she hed
sighted a midair explosion from her position at 13°44" North and 134°49' East,
and had searched the area for approximately 5-1/2 hours. Unable to contact
U. S. Navy radio stations at Manila or Guam prior to this time, she then as-
sumed the explosion must have been the result of military or naval exercises
and resumed the original course.
-8-
It was esteblished, upon interrogation of five of the crew members,
thet shipboard lookouts had observed a midair explosion at the approximate
position and time when N 6921C was expected to reach 14°00’ North and 135°00!'
Fast. It was recalled that a vapor trail, or some phenomenon resembling a
vapor trail, was first observed overhead and slightly to the north of the
tanker and moving in an east to west direction. The Lenzen was cruising on
e heading of O77° at this time. As this vapor trail passed behind a cloud,
there occurred an explosion which was described by the witnesses as intensely
luminous, with a white nucleus surrounded by a reddish-orange periphery with
radial lines of identically colored light. The explosion occurred in two
pulses lasting between two and three seconds and from it two flaming objects
of unequal brightness and size apparently fell, at disparate speeds, into the
sea. During the last 10 seconds of the fall of the slower of the two objects,
asmall bright target was observed on the ship's radar bearing 270°, range 17
miles.
The captain of the Lenzen stated that he arrived on deck in time to observe
the fall of the slower object for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeered
from view. He estimated its position in reference to a star and ordered the
ship's course reversed and, after aligning the heading of the vessel with’ the
star, found his heading to be 270° - the same as the bearing of the target
previously seen on the radar. The captain reported that the weather at this
tine was: “moonlight, clear atmosphere, 1/4 covered sky by smell cumulus
evenly distributed." The ship proceeded to the position of the radar target
~- 9 -
and searched the area until 2105 at which time the original course was resumed.
No signals or unusual sightings were reported.
The subsequent search, one of the most extensive ever conducted in the
history of aviation, covered 144,000 square miles and utilized 1,300 people,
48 aircraft, and 8 surface vessels. A total of 377 air sorties were flown
which involved over 3,417 flying hours. Despite the thoroughness of the
search, nothing was found which could conceivably be linked to the missing
aircraft or its occupants.
The aircraft’s emergency equipment included: five 25-man liferafts,
120 lifevests, 1 emergency transmitter (Gibson Girl), and 1 flare gun with
25 cartridges. Four of the liferafts were stored in the wing compartments;
the other was carried in the main cabin.
The historical, maintenance and inspection records of the aircraft were
examined. It was found that N 6921C was properly certificated and in an
airworthy condition; that all inspections had been performed within the
approved time limitations; and all Airworthiness Directives had been complied
with.
Records did indicate that on the previous flight from Honolulu to Travis
Air Force Base on March 12, 1962, the aircraft had returned to Honolulu with
the No. 4 engine propeller feathered. This was due to a significant power
loss, a drop of 19.21 BMEP on that engine, which occurred after 3 hours and
eT minutes of flight. The coils, plugs, leads, and ¥ lead were replaced on
the No. 17 cylinder of the No. 4 engine in Honolulu, and the flight then con-
tinued on to Travis Air Force Base without incident. The flight crew who
- 10-
nad flown N 6921C on this flight, when interviewed by Board investigators,
stated that there were no indications of impending failure in any of the
aircraft systems, structures, or engines and that the aircraft appeared to
pe airworthy in all respects at that time.
On March 13, 1962, prior to the departure of Flight 739/14, a terminal
check was conducted on N 6921C at the PTL maintenance base, San Francisco
International Airport. The records indicated that the aircraft departed
San Francisco for Travis Air Force Base in an airworthy condition.
Plight line and ramp areas of the en route airports used by N 6921C at
Honolulu, Wake Island, and Guam were examined by Board investigators. It
was found that access to these areas and to non-military aircraft parked
therein wes possible, without challenge, to anyone desiring entry. It was
reported that the aircraft was left unattended in a dimly lighted area for
a@ period of time while at Guam.
Analysis
A review of all records pertaining to the aircraft and crew as well
as a complete evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the disappearance
of the aircraft produced the following significant findings: N 6921C was
airworthy; the crew was qualified and currently certificated; the flight
was operated in accordance with company procedures except that there was
& lack of adequate crew rest facilities on the aircraft; minor maintenance
wes performed on the aircraft at Honolulu and at Wake Island, and no mainte-
nance was required at Guam; there were no emergency messages received
from N 6921C; a midair explosion, witnessed by crew members of the tanker
s/s v. Lb. Lenzen, occurred at an approximate time and location which
-ll-
coincided with the estimated position of the aircraft; weather was not a
factor in the disappearance; and no wreckage or debris was found that could
be associated with the aircraft.
Because no portion of the structure of N 6921C has been recovered, it is
impossible to determine whether a mechanical/structural failure, or sabotage,
occurred in flight. If such a failure did occur it can be reasonably assumed
that it happened suddenly and without warning to the crew. The lest message
received from Flight 739/14, a regularly scheduled position report, indicated
that it was cruising normally at an altitude of 18,000 feet; the message gave
no indication of any existing or. impending difficulty. It appears to be more
than coincidence that the explosion witnessed by crew members of the Lenzen
occurred near the position and at the time estimated by the aircraft's crew
for their next position report. It is, therefore, the opinion of the Board
that this witnessed phenomenon was most likely N 6921C in the process of
denolishment.
A summation of all relevant factors tends to indicate that the aircraft
was destroyed in flight. However, due to the lack of any substantiating evi-
dence the Board is unable to state with any degree of certainty the exact
fate of N 6921C.

Investigation
The Civil Aeronautics Board was notified of the unreported aircraft
at approximately 2200 G.m.t., March 15, 1962. An investigetion was inmedi-
ately initiated in accordance with the provisions of Title VII of the
Federal Aviation Act of 1958.
Air Carrier ,
The Flying Tiger Line Inc., is a scheduled air carrier incorporated
in the State of Delaware with its principal business offices at Burbank,
California. It holds a currently effective certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board, and an air carrier
operating certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Agency. These certi-
ficates authorize the company to transport cargo by air over numerous routes
within the Continental limits of the United States: The subject flight was
conducted under an exemption granted by the Civil Aeronautics Board which
authorizes the carrier to engage in interstate, overseas, and foreign air
transportation of persons and cargo pursuant to contracts with any depertment
