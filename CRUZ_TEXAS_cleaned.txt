U.S Senate Committee on Armed Services
Russell Senate Building Room 228
Washington, DC 20510-6050
The Honorable Senator Ted Cruz,
Dear Senator Cruz,
First, please accept my gratitude for your public service to our country as a United States Senator
representing Texas.
I am writing you and the other members of the U.S Senate Committee on Armed Services to
correct a grave injustice that has affected the families of 93 U.S. Army Rangers and the 11 flight
crew members aboard Flying Tiger Line Flight 739/14 N6921C bound for Saigon, Vietnam
which disappeared between Guam and the Philippines on March 16, 1962. My father, U.S.
Army Staff Sgt. Melvin Lewis Hatt, from Lansing, Michigan was on that flight.
Because of the Department of Defense statement of casualty as “non-battle” status for these
American heroes, they have been DENIED their rightful place on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in
Washington, DC since its establishment. Senator Cruz, this cannot stand.
Senator Cruz, five of these soldiers on that flight are from your represented state of Texas:
Edward Donald P. Cox, James A. Powell, Efisio Simola, Jr., Clarence Earl Thompson, and
John Cabot Wendell.
OUR MISSION IS
To bring tangible, visible honor and recognition to the 93 U.S. Army Rangers and flight crew
who gave their last full measure of devotion in service to their country March 16, 1962 aboard
Flying Tiger flight 739/14 enroute to Saigon, Vietnam. To bring their survivors and loved ones a
place to remember, receive long-overdue peace and comfort, as well as visible evidence that
their loved one’s life, service and sacrifice mattered.
Senator Cruz, the best way I can relate this to you is by telling you my personal story. I would
kindly ask that you read it, bearing in mind that my mission is to see that the names of every
servicemember on that flight are placed on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. as
well as the flight crew, all of whom served honorably as well.
The last letter my father, U.S. Army Staff Sgt Melvin Lewis Hatt from Sierra Vista, AZ wrote to
my grandmother in Lansing, contains these words “I am due in Port 15 Feb (Travis AFB CA) so
you can see I will be gone when this arrives.” The letter, dated February 11, 1962 goes on to say,
“I will probably fly as am due in Saigon, Vietnam, 25 Feb so am on a hurry up special
assignment, for sure.” That same day, this picture was taken of my father Melvin, mother
Patricia, me, and my younger sister, Sherri-Ann. I was five years old, Sherri was two. To this

Patricia, me, and my younger sister, Sherri-Ann. I was five years old, Sherri was two. To this
day, I have distinct memories of the servicemen at our door in Arizona, telling our mother that
her husband was missing in action.
A postcard to our grandmother dated March 15, 1962 from Wake Island Guam described the hot
weather and that they should arrive in Saigon the next morning, having crossed the international
dateline. There are images on-line of postcards sent to family by other victims from Guam. One
of the few things my dad told Sherri and I about this incident was that the passengers and crew
departed the plane in Guam, where it was left unattended on the tarmac, leading to suspicions of
sabotage as a reason for the plane’s disappearance.
Flying Tiger flight 739/14 was a Lockheed L-1049 Constellation prop liner. The flight departed
Travis AFB March 15, 1962 refueled uneventfully in Honolulu, and landed in Guam for
refueling, with the destination being Clark AFB Philippines and Saigon, Vietnam. The plane lost
radio contact 1 ½ hours after leaving Guam. Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) records indicate its
disappearance as the Western Pacific Ocean, Philippine Sea. The crew of the SS T.L. Lentzen
supertanker sighted a midair explosion at 12:30 a.m. local time. The subsequent search covering
144,000 square miles found nothing. www.planecrashinfo.com
The largest sea-and-air search that had ever been conducted at that time, was initiated 5 hours
after the plane’s fuel exhaustion time failed to turn up even a trace of the airline or its
passengers. “Due to the lack of substantiating evidence,” The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded
in its accident report back then, “the board is unable to state with any degree of certainty the
exact fate of N6921C.” Bangor Daily News, 2004, www.bangornews.com
As of 2017, fifty-five years later without an official declaration by the Defense Department of
killed in action, missing in action, or prisoners of war, the names of the 93 U.S. Army Rangers
do not appear on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. In addition to my
father, two other servicemen, Stanley McEntee (Detroit) and James Taylor (Olive Branch) were
from Michigan. The lack of inclusion on the National Wall has had a snowball effect with
Vietnam memorials in the State of Michigan, and Ingham County. My father’s name is not listed
on these memorials, either.
The justification by the Defense Department for non-inclusion is that “the circumstances of death
did not meet the criteria for inclusion on the VVM. They (sic) did not die in DIRECT support of
a combat mission. We have received many requests over the years, similar to this one, to add the
names of the victims of the Flying Tiger incident to the VVM.” Personal e-mail. U.S. Army
2001.
The 93 U.S. Army Rangers aboard Flight 739/14 were trained in chemical, biological and
radioactive warfare as well as jungle combat and communications. There has been speculation
over the years that these servicemen were part of a hand-picked team from all over the United
States sent to Vietnam in the very early days of the war. The fact that the plane never reached its
destination should not negate the original mission.

down, it would still bring great solace to surviving family members for their loved ones to be

Davis. www.stripes.com burke.matt@stripes.com July 24, 2013.
As I have read and re-read this article, I found the quote from a surviving son, Tommy Joe
Myers, son of Army Sgt. 1st Class Raymond “Bill” Myers to be perhaps the most disturbing.
Myers states that after years of being turned away and threatened when pressing for answers and
recognition, he has lost all hope. Why would a surviving son, asking for answers and the
inclusion of his fathers’ name on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial be threatened 50+ years
after the crash that took the lives of his father and 92 other U.S. Army Rangers?
Letters since the time of the VVM wall opened in 1982 have been written to the U.S. Army, the
Defense Department, and legislators, petitions on www.change.org have been signed. All to no
avail meeting denials and brick walls at every turn.
My adopted father, my father’s brother Normand Hatt, tried for years to get this accomplished.
The loss of his only brother devastated him. “He shared a little bit about that particular time and
the fear and upset” said Sherri Owen, my sister. “He just felt his world had been blown to
pieces.” Lansing State Journal. May 29, 2017. K. Lavey www.lsj.com. This was not to be
accomplished in his lifetime. He died in 2014.
Normand Hatt and his wife Laurene adopted Sherri and I after this incident in 1962 as our
mother Patricia suffered what was at time called a “nervous breakdown”. She would never
recover. Adding us to a family of four children, they provided us with a good life, and I am
forever grateful.
While doing some of my research, I did come across a bright spot in the midst of this quagmire.
In an article published November 13, 2017 by the Bellefontaine Examiner https://examiner.org
Sgt. John A. Karibo of Logan County, Ohio was officially recognized as Logan County’s first
casualty of the Vietnam War. John Roybal, an Air Force veteran, spoke of his experience being
part of the search party that looked for the missing plane. At the Veteran’s Day ceremony, he
presented flags to Sgt. Karibo’s surviving family members.
I find at times I feel the same frustration as other surviving family members, where to turn next,
how to cut through the red-tape and redactions of bureaucracy. This journey has been in fits and
starts, and where it will end I have no idea. What I do know is that the 93 U.S. Army Rangers
that perished that day in 1962 were American heroes, giving their last full measure of sacrifice in
service to their country. They do not deserve to be a forgotten memory of the Vietnam War, and
I am asking for your support and any assistance you have to offer to see that they are
honored and recognized on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C.
The snowball effect that I mention earlier has likely applied to every surviving family. Because
of the denial of their place on the VVM in Washington, they are denied a place of honor in their
home state, county, and city.
The efforts to accomplish this has been going on since the establishment of the Vietnam
Memorial Wall in 1982. The logic for the denial of placement on the VMW is insulting to the
bravery and memory of these brave souls “they did not die in DIRECT support of a combat
recognized for the mission they never got to complete,” said national VFW spokesman Joe
Davis. www.stripes.com burke.matt@stripes.com July 24, 2013.

related it took years and a FOIA to even get a true passenger list!
When I requested a change of casualty status for my father, I was instructed by e-mail that it
would have to go through the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. I was told further
that over the years numerous families have made the request that their loved one’s name be
added to the Vietnam Memorial Wall. DENIED.
Senator Cruz, there is precedent set to exception to this continuing litany of denial, secrecy, and
stone-walling. President Reagan in 1983 ordered that 68 soldiers be added. Those soldiers were
on an R&R in Hong Kong when their plane crashed. Sen. Charles Schumer, New York, is among
those lobbying for another exception: to include 74 sailors from the destroyer U.S.S. Frank
Evans. The ship sank after it was struck by an Australian aircraft carrier during a training
exercise in 1969, outside the designated combat zone. www.lsj.com K. Lavey May 29, 2017.
Quoting the Lansing State Journal Opinion Page May 28, 2017, “It’s been more than 50 years
since the Vietnam conflict and 35 years since the memorial was unveiled. What’s the harm in
bringing some peace to 93 families who want their loved ones to be forever remembered for
making the ultimate sacrifice to the United States?”
Senator Cruz, I would ask you and the other members of the Senate Committee for Armed
Services the same question. What is the harm? Why have there been YEARS of trying to
accomplish this by surviving family members only to be met with denial, lack of information,
redacted information, and threats? Did these families receive as much as a Gold Star? The
memorial services held for these 93 U.S. Army Rangers were held with no remains, as none
were ever found. Families lives were shattered and forever changed that fateful day, and over 50
years later, is this how they are rendered Thank you from a grateful nation?
I have enclosed copies of documents specifically relating to my father, Staff Sgt. Melvin Lewis
Hatt. Also enclosed are copies of the letter being sent to your colleagues on the committee, a
passenger list of soldiers and flight crew, and as much information as I have. If you have your
staff Google Flight 739/14 1962 Flying Tiger, you may be surprised at the number of entries.
As of this letter, I have been asked to provide the information about this mission to Bob Higley,
Commander, The American Legion Department of Michigan, 6th District Association, John
Meka, Post Commander, Haslett Post 269 (Michigan), and MG James A. Pocock, AUS (Ret)
after a presentation I gave December 14, 2017 at the Haslett MI Post. They are in support of this
mission.

Good evening. Thank you so much for having me here to tell the story about how the
crash of Flight 739114 in 1962 dramatically changed my family's life. This "walk to the
Wall" however it should turn out, is dedicated to my sister, Sherri-Ann Owen, and our
dad, Normand Hatt, whose only brother gave his life in service to our country.

described the hot weather and that they should arrive in Saigon the next morning,
having crossed the international dateline. There are images on-line of postcards sent to
family by other victims from Guam. One of the few things my dad told Sherri and I about
this incident was that the passengers and crew departed the plane in Guam, where it
was left unattended on the tarmac, leading to suspicions of sabotage as a reason for
the plane's disappearance.
Flying Tiger flight 739114 was a Lockheed L-1049 Constellation prop liner. The flight
departed Travis AFB March 15, 1962 refueled uneventfully in Honolulu, and landed in
Guam for refueling, with the destination being Clark AFB Philippines and Saigon,
Vietnam. The plane lost radio contact 1 lzhours after leaving Guam. CivilAeronautics
Board (CAB) records indicate its disappearance as the Western Pacific Ocean,
Philippine Sea. The crew of the SS T.L. Lentzen supertanker sighted a midair explosion
at12:30 a.m. local time. The subsequent search covering 144,000 square miles found
nothing. www. pla necrashinfo. com
The largest sea-and-air search that had ever been conducted at that time, was initiated
5 hours after the plane's fuel exhaustion time failed to turn up even a trace of the airline
or its passengers. "Due to the lack of substantiating evidence," The Civil Aeronautics
Board concluded in its accident report back then, "the board is unable to state with any
degree of certainty the exact fate of N6921C." Bangor Daily News, 2004,
www.bangornews.com
As of 2017, fifty-five years later without an official declaration by the Defense
Department of killed in action, missing in action, or prisoners of war, the names of the
93 U.S. Army Rangers do not appear on the Vietnam Veterans MemorialWall in
Washington, D.C. ln addition to my father, two other servicemen, Stanley McEntee
(Detroit) and James Taylor (Olive Branch) were from Michigan. The lack of inclusion on
the NationalWall has had a snowball effect with Vietnam memorials in the State of
Michigan, and lngham County. My father's name is not listed on these memorials,
either.
The justification by the Defense Department for non-inclusion is that "the circumstances
of death did not meet the criteria for inclusion on the WM. They (sic) did not die in
DIRECT support of a combat mission. We have received many requests over the years,
similar to this one, to add the names of the victims of the Flying Tiger incident to the
WM.' Personal e-mail. U.S. Army 20A1.
The 93 U.S. Army Rangers aboard Flight 739114 were trained in chemical, biological
and radioactive warfare as well as jungle combat and communications. There has been
speculation over the years that these servicemen were part of a hand-picked team from
all over the United States sent to Vietnam in the very early days of the war. The fact that
the plane never reached its destination should not negate the original mission.
ln an article of Stars and Stripes, and I quote "Though we may never know why the
aircraft went down, it would still bring great solace to surviving family members for their
loved ones to be recognized for the mission they never got to complete," said national
VFW spokesman Joe Davis. www.stripes.com burke.matt@stripes.com July 24,2013.
As I have read and re-read this article, I found the quote from a surviving son, Tommy
Joe Myers, son of Army Sgt. 1"t Class Raymond "Bill" Myers to be perhaps the most
disturbing. Myers states that after years of being turned away and threatened when
pressing for answers and recognition, he has lost all hope. Why would a surviving son,
asking for answers and the inclusion of his fathers' name on the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial be threatened 50+ years after the crash that took the lives of his father and g2
other U.S. Army Rangers?
Letters since the time of the WM wall opened in 1982 have been written to the U.S.
Army, the Defense Department, and legislators, petitions on www.chanqe.orq have
been signed. All to no avail meeting denials and brick walls at every turn.
My adopted father, my father's brother Normand Hatt, tried for years to get this
accomplished. The loss of his only brother devastated him. "He shared a little bit about
that particular time and the fear and upset" said Sherri Owen, my sister. "He just felt his
or its passengers. "Due to the lack of substantiating evidence," The Civil Aeronautics

Normand Hatt and his wife Laurene adopted Sherri and I after this incident in 1962 as
our mother Patricia suffered what was at time called a "neryous breakdown". She would
never recover. Adding us to a family of four children, they provided us with a good life,
and I am forever grateful.
While doing some of my research, I did come across a bright spot in the midst of this
quagmire. ln an article published November 13, 2017 by the Bellefontaine Examiner
https://examiner.oro Sgt. John A. Karibo of Logan County, Ohio was officially
recognized as Logan County's first casualty of the Vietnam War. John Roybal, an Air
Force veteran, spoke of his experience being part of the search party that looked for the
missing plane. At the Veteran's Day ceremony, he presented flags to Sgt. Karibo's
surviving family members.
I find at times I feel the same frustration as other surviving family members, where to
turn next, how to cut through the red-tape and redactions of bureaucracy. This journey
has been in fits and starts, and where it will end I have no idea. What I do know is that
the 93 U.S. Army Rangers that perished that day in 1962 were American heroes, giving
their last full measure of sacrifice in service to their country. They do not deserve to be a
forgotten memory of the Vietnam War, and I am asking for your support and any
assistance you have to offer to see that they are honored and recognized on the
Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C.
I would like to acknowledge the support of Alexis Begale, Kathleen Lavey, and David
Jones. Their interest in the importance of this walk to the Wall has inspired me and re-
energized my efforts. The immediate reply of an e-mail sent to Matt Burke at Stars and
Stripes this week offering his assistance means everything.

In order to change the casualty status, the family would have to petition
the Army Board for correction of Military Records. we have received many
requests, similar to this one, over the years, to add the names of the
victims of the Flying Tigers aircraft intident to the wM. The
circumstances of these deaths did not meet the criteria for inclusion on the
wM: they did not die in DIRECT support of a combat mission. If Ms. Ellis
wishes to pursue this matter, please urk ihut she direct her request for the

Dear TAPC Officer:
I am writing to request an IDpF for my father, Melvin L. Hatt. United
States Army, DOD 16 March 1962.
I am also enclosing the information that I have in hopes that it may
expedite the process. The information is from a Statement of casualty dated
20 April1962.
I am asking your help or the next point of contact for a couple different
issues which I will explain further.
Additionally, I am including the text of a letter written to the Michigan
vietnam Memorialcommission. The MI vietnam Memorial is to be dedicated
Sunday November ll,20ol. while it is too late to have his rurme on the wall
at the actual dedication, the commission meets again in mid -December to
decide on additions, changes and deletions of names.
l) the issue is that my father is risted as Non-Battle status, which appears
t9 dgry my family the right of having his name listed on the vietnarn wall in
washington, D.c. we were not abre to get his name listed on the memorial in
Ingham county, Michigan for the sa-e ieason. It now appears that I may face
the same trial with the new memorial site in Lansing, Mrfor the state of
Michigan.

Guam and the Philippines. Intensive air-sea rescue operations were launched
and revealed no evidence of survivors or wreckage of the airplane. This
information comes from an email copy of the Statement of casualty dated 20
pril,1962. (copy enclosed) casualty status is listed as l6 March 1962_
Because my father's casualty status is listed as Non-Battle, requests to
have his name listed on the vietnam wal in washington, D. c. have been
denied. He was en route to vietnam on active duty slatus at the time of his
death, along with162 others who left family members and loved ones behind.
Enclosed are copies of the last correspondence we have from my father
written to his mother. There has been speculation as to the disappearance of
the plane after re-fueling in Guam (such as a detonating device), with many
unanswered questions.
My father dedicated his life to the service of his country, first serving in
the Navy and then in the Army until his untimely death. Enclosed are
newspaper clippings about his service.
I believe for his name not to be included on a vietnam Memorial is a sad
commentary to dedicated military service. I have often wondered about the
families of the other service people onboard that plane. Have their loved
ones also been excluded from memorials in Washington and their home states?
we were also denied his name on the memorial in Mason, MI (the county seat
of Ingham his place of birth and his home) when not living on a U.S. base
or on foreign soil serving his country for the same reason Non-battle
status.
I would appreciate your review of this situation- I have provided as much
information as I have. I am sure that with your resources the review panel
will be able to gather the military records that may be required
I understand that the Michigan Memorial is scheduled for completion in
November 2001. To that end, I would like to see my father, Melvin Lewis
Hatt, have his name included on that memorial, and at long last receive the
recognition and honor due him. whether by a bullet or shot down by enemy
fire, the fact of the matter remains. My father and 161 others were killed
as a result of the vietnam "conflict". The lives of 162 families were
forever changed. Please let the state of Michigan be a leader in the
acknowledgment of those lost to the "cause" of the vietnam conflict in
service to their country.
I look forward to hearing from you very soon.

DON'T EXCLT]DE FALLEN SOLDIERS
Soldiers who died when Flight 739 went down en route

on a memorial in Ingham County," Ellis
saitl
Ellis's request is reasonable. As a
nation, ure should honor all of our ser-
vicemen and servicewomen. We should
be finding ways to be inclusive, rather
than allowiDg narrow guidelines to
limit recogpition.
The military is rigid by natttre. It's
necessary to have protocols and stan-
dards to ensure tle safety of U.S.
troops. Clear definitions help personnel
make swift decisions that are tmiform-
ly recogaized by their peers and sub-
ordinates.
Yet the guidelines for recognizing
military persomel onthe Vietnam WaIl
seem needlessly narrow
According to Department of Defense
guidelines, those eligible to be listed on
the monument include soldiers who
served in Vietnam, Cambodia,Iaos and
designated coastal areas between 1959
and 1975; and died within 120 days of
wounds, injuries or illnesses incurred
in the combat zone.
There were 58,000 names listed
when the wall was unveiled in 1982.
Since ttren, hundreds have been added.
President Reagan in 1983 ordered that
the names of 68 soldiers be added.
Those soldiers were on an R&R trip in
Hong Kong when their plane crashed.
Itk been more than 50 years since
the Vietnam conflict and 35 years since
the memorial wall was unveiled. Whatk
the harm in bringing some peace to 93
families who want their loved ones to
be forever remembered for making the
ultimate sacrifice in service to the
United States?
Adding Hatt's name - and the names
of the others on Flight 739 - takes noth-
ing away from the men and women
whose names are already etched in
store. It doesnt tmdermine the guide-
lines put in place for memorial,
What it does, however, is show these
soldiers' families - and all Americans -

Before departing for Vietnam 51 years ago, Army Sgt. 1st Class Raymond "Bill" Myers left behind his lD, dog tags and a gold ring he had
never taken off before. He told his brother-in-law that he had a bad feeling about the mission and didn't think he would be coming home.
He asked him to watch over his wife and children after he was gone.

Myers' son, Tommy Joe - like the families of the other lost Americans - has no answers about his father's fate. Adding to that pain is
how his father and the others have been forgotten. Their names are not on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., and no
government agencies - Army, Air Force, Defense Department, National Archives, State Department, CIA - admit to possessing records
related to the soldiers and their mission. None could provide Stars and Stripes with a list of the deceased, although they are mentioned in
a Civil Aeronautics Board crash report from 1962.
A petition has been launched to get the names added to the wall. Proponents face an uphill baftle and need to prove that the plane was
headed to Vietnam for a combat mission - which has been impossible without documentation - or through the special intervention of
elected officials.

"They were flying into harm's way," said Frank Allen, the Massachusetts man who started the change.org petition in October. Allen is
related to one of the men, Sgt. Howard Gallipeau Jr., by maniage. "Had they survived and landed, they might have died under difierent
circumstances. The military treats it like a car accident. They should be honored for what they did."
Allen's petition calls for 1,000 signatures, although they are hoping for many more. The petition will be sent to Defense Department
officials after it closes in Oclober.
Tommy Joe Myers said after years of being turned away and threatened when pressing for answers and recognition, he has lost all hope
"lt's hurtful that they won't put these guys' names on the wall,' he said. "People need to know what these guys sacrificed. Just give them
the same courtesy and respect other guys have gotten."
A few good men
ln early 1962, the U.S. was slowly ramping up involvement in Vietnam, according to editions of Pacific Stars and Stripes from the time.
Known military operations were limited mosUy to advising the South Vietnamese, and ferrying troops into battle and limited engagements
with communist forces when fired upon.
The men on Flight 739 appear to have been hand-picked for the mission; they came from bases across the country, acrording to Vietnam
veteran and retired Marine Bruce Swander, who has spent the last 10 years researching the flight in an effort to get their names added to
the wall. He said his research indicates they were advisers trained in communications and not Special Forces.
Pacific Stars and Stripes reported after the plane disappeared that the men were trained jungle troops.
Myers was an all-American boy, according to his son. He grew up in Carterville, lll., with Steve McQueen good looks and piercing blue
eyes. He played minor league baseball in the St. Louis Cardinals organization and commanded attention when he entered the room. But
his real passion was military service.

Tommy Joe Myers said after years of being turned away and threatened when pressing for answers and recognition, he has lost all hope
"lt's hurtful that they won't put these guys' names on the wall,' he said. "People need to know what these guys sacrificed. Just give them
the same courtesy and respect other guys have gotten."
A few good men
ln early 1962, the U.S. was slowly ramping up involvement in Vietnam, according to editions of Pacific Stars and Stripes from the time.
Known military operations were limited mosUy to advising the South Vietnamese, and ferrying troops into battle and limited engagements
with communist forces when fired upon.
The men on Flight 739 appear to have been hand-picked for the mission; they came from bases across the country, acrording to Vietnam
veteran and retired Marine Bruce Swander, who has spent the last 10 years researching the flight in an effort to get their names added to
the wall. He said his research indicates they were advisers trained in communications and not Special Forces.
Pacific Stars and Stripes reported after the plane disappeared that the men were trained jungle troops.
Myers was an all-American boy, according to his son. He grew up in Carterville, lll., with Steve McQueen good looks and piercing blue
eyes. He played minor league baseball in the St. Louis Cardinals organization and commanded attention when he entered the room. But
his real passion was military service.

Myers received his orders to head to Vietnam on March 13, 1962, according to a copy of the orders obtained by stars and Stripes. The
next morning he would be on the ill-fated Military Air Transport Service chartered Flying Tiger Line Flight 739.
As was the case with Myers, spc' 4 Roger oliver's family put a headstone in the ground in his hometown after the plane disappeared.
oliver' ftom Vidory, wis', was "very studious," and he joined the Army and was trained in communications, according to his sister, Gloria
Oliver Warmuth.
He also told his father that he wouldn't be coming home from the mission and asked him to take care of his pregnant wi6 and baby after
he was gone. His daughter was born later that year.
"He said' 'l won't be back from this,'" oliver's daughter, Kristina Hoge, told stars and stripes. "My grandfather totd him, .you'll be fine., I
think it haunted my grandfather.,,
Hoge said over the years she was told by her father's friends that he was involved in ,'black ops.,,A condolence letter from his
commanding ofiicer at Fort Leonard wood, Mo., states that he worked in the Film Library Division there. Her mother thought he was
going to Vietnam to make a kaining film.

"no man's land" during fighting. He would be wounded in adion, have surgery and re-enlist. He was tough but warmhearted, his son,
Howard Gallipeau lil, told Stars and Stripes.
Eerily, the sergeant too told his wife he would not be coming back alive.
"Before he left, he said, 'l don't think I'm going to be coming home from this one,' " his son said. "My mom tried to talk him out of going but
he said. 'l have to serve my country-,"
The three families contacted by stars and stripes said they didn't know each other and hadn't shared their stories among themselves.
Flight 739
Flight 739 left Travis Air Force Base on March 14, 1962, with a destination of Saigon, according to a copy of the 1962 Civil Aeronautics
Board crash report obtained by stars and stripes. No cargo other than passengers, crewmembers and their belongings was reported.
U.S. Army Security Service checked all passengers including the unknown foreign nationals.
The flight successfully stopped for refueling in Honolulu, where minor maintenance was performed on the engine ignition systems before
they departed for wake lsland, the report said. They arrived at wake, u,here maintenance was once again performed before heading to
Guam. They arrived at Guam with no reported problems.

Army Sgt. 1st Class Raymond "Bill" Myers, seen here with his wife Irene, disappeared, along with 92 other U.S. troops, when the plane they were
riding in went done in the Pacific Ocean March 16, 1962 somewhere between Guam and the Philippines.
‘PHOTO COURTESY OF TOMMY JOE MYERS
“There were no mechanical discrepancies reported and no maintenance was required,” the report said.
After a short layover, they were off again to Clark Air Base, Philippine Islands. They contacted control several times during their flight, and
no disturbances or issues were reported.
They were last heard from just after midnight March 16, 1962, 270 miles west of Guam.
Shortly after, the flight stopped answering radio transmissions, the report said. They were never heard from again.
‘Search-and-rescue operations were launched from Guam and the Philippines within hours, the report said. A Liberian-flagged Standard
Oil of California super tanker and its Italian crew reported seeing a midair explosion in the area where Flight 739 should have been.
“It was recalled that a vapor trail, or some. phenomenon resembling a vapor trail, was first observed overhead and slightly to the north of
the tanker and moving in an east to west direction,” the report said.
“As this vapor trail passed behind a cloud, there occurred an explosion, which described by witnesses as intensely luminous, with a white
nucleus surrounded by a reddish-orange periphery with radial lines of identically colored light. The explosion occurred in two pulses
lasting between two and three seconds and from it two flaming objects of unequal brightness and size apparently fell, at disparate
speeds, into the sea.”
A bright target was observed on the ship's radar during the last 10 seconds of the fall of the slower of the two objects, the report said. The
ship changed its course and searched the area for 5% hours with no results.
Over the next eight days, an armada of more than 50 planes and 7th Fleet assets searched 75,000 square miles of sea around the clock
between Guam and the Philippines. Two Stars and Stripes reporters covered the search.
“I remember flying around in the aircraft for hours and hours and hours,” former Stripes reporter Paul Rogers recalled recently. Rogers
said no theories emerged at the time as to what happened to the plane. “We were really just looking for it.”

so time continues to pass; wives and siblings of the 93 passengers grow old or die. Their children have no place among fellow veterans
to honor the fathers they barely knew.
"Getting their names on the wall in washington, D.c., would be an awesome thing," Howard Gallipeau lll said. He believes his father
deserves a spot' "He went to war and didn't come home. He died for his country. That makes him a hero."

"l get goose bumps thinking about how close I was to getting on that plane," Asensio said. "My main concern is to get those guys, names
on the wall."
The wall
The guidelines for incrusion on the Vietnam Memoriar are mandated by congress.
since '1982, changes have been made to the eligibility requirements but the general rules state that the someone can be added if they
died - regardless of cause or circumstance - within the designated cpmbat zone boundaries, if combat-related wounds, accident or
illness incured in country led to their death elsewhere, or if they were "going to or returning from,, a combat mission.
Army officials told stars and stripes that the men on Flight 739 did not meet the criteria for serving in the "vietnam area of responsibility.,,
Swander said he had hoped to prove that the men fell under the third option. However, with no documentation available, it has been
impossible.
"The problem from day one has been to document that these men were on a 'mission'- as opposed to replacements or manpower
escalation'" he said' "unfortunately, all records showing what they were trained in, why they were picked and what they were going to do
there have been redacted fiom their files."
swander said the men do not fit cleanly within the rules, which are open to interpretations depending on who looks at each case.
over the years, there have been two exceptions, but both took speciar intervention.
Names have been added for a heart attack at a desk in Thailand, or a stateside suicide afier being freed from a communist prison,
Swander said.
But the example that most strongly supports including those on Flight 739 is the addition of names of servicemembers who died after a
MarinecorpsKc-l30Fcrashedintotheseaupontake-offfromHongKongonAug.24,lg6s.
The plane was returning to Vietnam from a rest-and-recuperation period so the troops on board could finish their tours, Swander said.
The 54 Marines who lost their lives were added to the wall in 1983, and the five sailors who died were added a year later thanks to
approval by President Ronald Reagan.
"Although the aircraft was en route to vietnam, it was outside of the designated war zone," swander said.
Family anguish
Answers as to what happened to the men of Flight 739 anct their mission remains elusive.
The only document received after requests from stars and Stripes from any government agency was a report that detaired sorties that
searched for Flight 739.
Despite the coordinates of the explosion being known, Joint PowMlA Acc,ounting command officials never searched for wreckage
because the incident was never assigned to them as a killed-in-action case, a spokesman said. A spokeswoman from the Defense
PowMissing Personner ffice said they are responsibre for wartime rosses onry.
Neither the Air Force casualty office nor the Army's Human Resources command, which trac*s casualties, had any information.
"lt's like they were meant to disappear," Gloria Oliver Warmuth said. "They have been forgotten.,,
Everyone briefed on the details of the case seems to be in agreement, that more needs to be done for the 93 that were lost.
"lt really burns me up when things like this happen with the loss of an aircraft and its crew/passengers and the incident is quickly
forgotten'" Travis Air Force Base historian Mark lMlderman wrote in an email to stars and stripes after finding nothing in an exhaustive
search of their records. Failure to recognize their efforts dishonors the folks who lost their lives in the line of duty, he said.

spec. 4 Leonard wedge of MiltinoCket were among th" toz passengers -
93 u's' Army special Forces Rangers, three vietnimese soldiers uio t r crew members - aboard the Flying Tiger
Line super constellation, N6921c, that lost radio contact and disappeared not iong after taking offfrom Guam, en
route to Saigon.
The largest sea-and-air search that had ever been conducted at the time failed to tum up even ataceof the airplane
or its passengers.
"Due to the lack of any substantiating evidence," the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded in its accident report back
then, "the Board is unable to state with any degree of certainty the exact fate of N69 21C.,
More tlan 40 years later, the Defense Departuent still has never officially declared the lost servicemen as kilied in
action, missing in action, or as prisonert of war. Consequently, without u "1"*
determination of their fate, their
ffrmes 9o "ot appear on the vietnarn Veterans Memorial *uff i" warningtoo, nc., beside all ofthe others who are
honored for having sacrificed. their lives in the tine of duty-
For Mary Joy, the omission is an i4iustice that she hopes to correct.
"so far, everything remains just one big blanlq' said Joy, the wife 9f Rep, Henry Joy of the Aroostook County
town of Crystal, who grew up in Millinocket and was Leonard weage's chilauoto friend. ,,I want to get some
answers so that these men will be properly recognized one day. It's i if they've been completely foigouen.,,
According-to newspaper accounts, the Ftying Tiger civilian aircraft, chartered as a military transport, took offfrom
Travis AFB, near san Francisco, and landedl, drr.*. After refueling, the plane left Guam, bound" for the
Philippines and then on to vietram, where some 4,000 U.S. servic"il"o were stationed in tirose murky early days
of the conflict' Just 1-5 hours after leaving Guarrl ho*"r*., its radio signal was suddenly lost and the airplane

disappeared from the sky. The crew of a Liberian oil tanker in the area reported seeing a "vapor trail go behind a
cloud," followed by a flash of light in the sky-
The subsequent 12-day searctl which covered 144,000 square miles with 48 military aircraft and eight ships,
tuTed up nothing. In a March 17 Washington Post story about the missing plane, offrcials of the Flying Tiger Line
raised the possibilities of sabotage or kidnapping, although they had no evidence of either. Another of their
arplanes had inexplicably crashed and burned in the Aleutian Islands after taking offfrom Ggam about the same
time as the missing aircraft, a coincidence that only added to their suspicions of foul play-
The investigation ended with no conclusive answers, however, and the carse of the airplane's disappearance was
offtcially and forever listed as "undetermined."
Back in Millinocket Wedge left a wife and 2-week-old son. His mother, Geraldine, received a letter from the
4yoY announcing that her son was missing, fuf nqfhing more. Like the airplane he flew on, 23-year-old Leonard
Wedge's fate has remained a mystery to this day.
Joy, who had been in touch occasionally with Wedge's mother until her death about a year ago, became intrigued
with Wedge's disappearatrce and military status when the touring version of the Vietnam Veierans wall stopp-ed in
the town of Shennan Station a few years ago. At the ceremony, she discovered that Wedge and the two other
Maine men on the 1962 flight were not listed on the wa1l. Curious, she began collecting old ne*s arricles about the
42-year-old incident and whatever sketchy documented inforrnation she could find.
She eventually leamed that Wedge and the others were considered by the Army to be "special liaisons," and
therefore never were granted the status of actual Vietnam War combatants. The Arrny, for reasons Joy has yet to
determine, wrote offthe incident long ago without ever declaring the soldiers involved to have been officially
killed in action.
"And without that declaration, their names can't go on the wall with the others who fought there," she said. "They
have no official status with the government whatsoever, which is terribly wrong. There's never been any closure-"
As Joy found out on the Interne! the family of at least one ofthe other missing servicemen feels a similar sense of
injustice. The daughter of George Michael Nau, a ftight engineer from Wisconsin who was aboard the lost
airplane, has created a Web site to honor her father's memory and to fight to get his nane listed on the veterans
wall- On the Web site, she relates some of the speculative theories she has read about over the years that attempt to
explain ttre airplane's mysterious disappearance: That it might have been shot down by a Russian ICBM missile;
that it might have been hijacked to Chinar where the passengers and crew were interrogated tortured and killed;
an$ that it might have been accidentally shot down by a Navy pilot whose missile arming switch was mistakenly
left on during training exercises.
"I feel, as many other surviving relatives and all who are familiar with this story agree, that there has been a grave
injustice by our government who assigned and sent them on their mission," wrote Nau's daughter. She said sfie is
hoping to join with relatives and friends of the other missing servicemen on that flight who have never been
properly honored for their wartime sacrifices.
Joy said she has spoken to Wedge's sister, who lives in New York and is also eager to clear up some of the

Sabetage Seen as Possi'oility in Lost ptane
r,,AHILA (Ap) - A repoft of .r mysterious flash of iight in the sky increased suspicion today
that the Arnerican chartered nriliiary five nights ago bler.r up and vras possibty
sabotaged.
U.5. officials said a "bright tight strong enough to tight', a ship's deck was sighted by a
Liberian tanker in the u/estern Pacific along lhe scheduted rotite of the missing Ftying
Tiger Super Constetlation bound for South Viet Ham v/ith '107 prsons aboard.
A spokesman at rescue headquarters in Guam said, .v/ith the search in its fourti day,
more credence is given to the possibitity that th€ tanl(er may ha';e s€en the missing
aircraft exptode in ftight."
An officiat of the Fllng liger [ine, wfrich operated the ptane, said if investigation revea{s
the ptane btevr up, it vrould strengthen previous suspicions of sibotage.
Frank 8. Lynoff, exmutive vice president in charge of operations, said experts consider
it impossibte for a violent explosion to cccur abcut its Super Constettations under normal
conditions.
The tanker T. L. Linzen said it sighted the bright tight in the sky earty Friday morning -
about 90 nrinutes after the ptane made its last report.
The Super Constettation was tast heard from about t0:30 p.nr. Thursday, 270 mites lvest

searched. By the end of the search, over 2oo.ooo square miLes
were scoured for any wreckage, but nothing vzas founcl rhe search

Flying Tiger Line Flight 7rrs/L3'operating as Military Air Transport Service (MATS) charter flight739/14. originated at
Travis AFB with refueling stops at Honolulu, wake Isiand, Guam, clark AFB and wai to terminate at Saigon. The flight
arrived at Guam at ll:.14 GMT with the only irregularities on the way being minor maintenance on the ignition systems of
engines no' I and 3 at Honolulu, a 30 min delay at Honolulu because of stewardess complaints of inadequate rest facilities
aboard, and minor maintenance at Wake Island (discrepancies in the no. I and 3 engine igrrition systems). The flight
departed Guam at 12:57 GMT for an IFR flight to Clark AFB, philippine Islands with an ETA of l9:16 GMT.
The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of 18000 feet and reported ieing at position l3 40T{ and 140 00,E at 14:22. Te

Fifty-four years before Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing another airliner vanished over the

March 15,1962 a Flying Tiger Line Li049H Super Constellation, bound from Agana NavalAir
Station in Guam to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines simply ceased to exist. N 6921C, Flying
Tiger Flight73gl14, disappeared at 1 3o13' North Latitude, 140000' East Longitude - over an all but
bottomless patch of the Pacific, an abyss called the Mariana Trench. This deepest of all
depressions in the Earth's crust is an astonishing 6.78 miles deep - this compared to the
relatively shallow 300-feet or so along MH370's original projected flight path.
ln all probability it's the virtually bottomless depths of the Pacific that entomb the remains of "21
Charlie," the call sign of the Flying Tiger Connie.
21 Charlie, operating as a charter flight for the Military Air Transport Service, was ferrying
American Army personnelfrom Travis Air Force Base, California to Saigon, to a country we once
called South Vietnam. There were 107 people on board that airplane. one of them was my
stepfather. He was the co-pilot.
Bob Gazzaway was a pugnacious, plucky sort of guy who'd survived all that tife could dish out -
and that included being a Naval aviator during world war 1 1. ln command of the connie (the
nickname of the super constellation), was captain Gregory p. Thomas, one of Flying Tigers, most
experienced pilots.
21 Charlie's path across the Pacific was placid. An Aircraft Accident Report obtained by this
reporter from the U's' civil Aeronautics Board (the predecessor of the Nationat rransportation
Safety Board) says the weather that night was good - broken cumutus clouds, no turbulence, and
moonlit visibility of 15 miles - the kind of night airmen relish.
At22 minutes after midnighl,2l charlie radioed its position. lt was the last the outside world
would hear from the crew. About an hour later the erew of the s/s r L Lenzen, a standard oil
tanker, spotted an explosion in the sky. According to the cAB report, the crew spotted .,a vapor
trail' or some phenomenon resembting a vapor trail overhead...As this vapor trail passed behind a
cloud' there occurred an explosion which was described by the witnesses as intensely luminous,
with a white nucleus surrounded by a reddish-orange periphery with radial lines of identically
colored lights."
what happened? The cAB courdn't determine a probabre cause.
ln the absence of hard physical evidence, rumors ran rampant, just as they have with Malaysia
Flight 370' At the time people speculated about engine problems, sabotage, even the accidental
shoot down of the connie by an American missile, an inadvertent act that scuttlebutt said was
covered up by an embarrassed Pentagon at the beginning of what would mutate into the most
unpopular war in American history.
Lending at least anecdotal credence to the shootdown and sabotage theories is a statement by
captain Duilio Bona. The late award-winning investigative reporter David Morrissey and I obtained
a copy of his declaration after filing a Freedom of lnformation request with the United States
government' ln his declaration, captain Bona said some fascinating things. Among the more
intriguing: the witnesses aboard the Lenzen were "convinced lthat the craft they saw explode was
"a U.S. Airplane...on [military] exercise flights.,,

"a U.S. Airplane...on [military] exercise flights.,,
one of Bona's crewmembers, a lookout named scarfi said, "he saw a jet vapor track,,,according to
the captain' 2l charlie was a piston-engine airtiner. Shortly after the vapor trial, Bona said scarfi
recalled, "a bright light illuminated, as a lightning, the bridge lof the ship].,,
Lenzen's radio operator said there were no distress signals from the aircraft, a statement that led
the cAB to conclude in its Accident Report "lt can be reasonably assumed" that whatever befell 21
Charlie "happened suddenty and without warning.,,
captain Bona said the radio operator of Lenzen tried "repeatedly" to contact Navar radio stations
in Guam, Manila, okinawa, and lwo Jima - allto no avail. And that led to Bona,s conclusion ,,that
what we saw was a troubled secret operation.,,
Troubled by what, or by whom, Bona never said. A missile? sabotage perhaps? Remember, this
was the cold war, and vietnam was just beginning to heat up. ln its report, the cAB said when 2i
charlie was parked at Honolulu, wake lsland, and Guam just about anyone could access the
aircraft "without challenge...the aircraft was left unattended in a dimly lighted area for a period of
time while at Guam."
ln a letter on the disaster the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation concluded the Bureau ,,did not
anticipate [launching an investigation] untess substantial evidence of willful destruction is
developed."
Then there's a more mundane theory: engine problems. Three days before it disappe ared, zl
charlie had to return to Honolulu when number four engine developed "a significant power loss.,,
Shootdown, sabotage or something else? The odds are we'll never know. 21 charlie carried no
flight data recorder, no cockpit voice recorder. The United States government says evidence of
"willful destruction" was never recovered - this despite one of the most massive sea searches in
history a quest covering 144,ooo square miles of ocean that employed 1,300 people,4g aircraft,
and 8 surface vessels. "Despite the thoroughness of the search," concluded the Civil Aeronautics
Board, "nothing was found which could conceivably be linked to the missing aircraft or its
occupants."
And so it is, 54 years after the fact, that the fate of the Flying Tiger connie and 107 souls on board
remains a mystery - a mystery the answers to which are shrouded by seven miles of water.

I won't claim to know why the Sovemnent is denying these men their rightfuI place on the Memorial

7962. According to another
the first U.S. troops
entered Vietnam in March 1965.
Three years difference, between when the Lockheed was supposed to land, and the,official, enlrance of
U.S. troops into this conflict.
zvhat was the proposed mission of these men? Had they actually completed their joumey, could there
have been a difference in the outcome of the war?

March 15,2a12 Update: The above post was copied in its entirety and posted on another blog. I4trhile
there has been a lot of discussion there, I'd like to reprint some of the info that has been shared:
" 'the 'rules' gooerning Additions to theW Memorial wall. IMiIe somewhat complex, they arebroken down into
three (3) general scenarios:
7' Anyone who dies_- regardless of cause - on foreign soil within southvietnam, Northvietnam, Laos, Cambodia.
This also includes boundaries that stretch a fan miles out into the south China ses that are designated war-zontz.
Note the word 'few,.
2' Deaths that occur outside of the Tnar-zone area, but are attributable to eaents that occurred there. These are
usually indiaiduals eoacuted out due to rnounds, illnesses, accidents, etc - and subsequently died shorgy thereafter.
3' Indioiduals that died while "going to, or returning from" a specific war-relatedMIssloN . This change was
made primartly for Pilots/Crew who crashed after aNIa,/ bombing iaid in Thailand...which is outside of the war-
zone b oun d sries est ablishe d.
Based on aarious documentst no arSument canbe made that this crash occurred within the feut miles of svN...no
flotsam was eaer found.
Houteoer, a theoretical argument could be made that these soldiers were 'going to' SVN on a specific war-related
mission (as opposed tobeing new replacements). The CAB report iorrTou reference that they were
Communications Specialists - a group being sent there for a critical purpose of the war.
The problem is that of all of the Personnel Files obtained (about 35 so far) - ALL haae been excised of any training
receiaed prior to this crash. Without those records, I cannot determine in what communications genre they were
trained in, what Army or MACV lJnit they were to be assigned to once there, or the specific reason/mission they
were to perform.
Also, this:
The VietnamVeterans Memorial Fund receiaes numerous requests each year from indiuiduals who ilesire to hau.
particular names placed on the Memorial. rhile the Memorial Fund finoirrc ih, ,r*, additions to The Wall, we do
not determine whose names are to be inscrfued. lt is the Departmeni of Defense that makes these dfficult and often
uery technical decisions. Our organization does not haoe the authirity'to ouerrule those who aijudicate these
matters.
Neither victims of Agent Orange nor PTSD-induced suicides fit the parametus for inclusion on The Wall. (Click
- . _ here for a brief summary of the ffiteria and sources for names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial).
We are often asked to add a name that DOD has not approaed. Much emotion has surrounded the question of names
not included on the list. Many families whose sons were taken from them in seroice during the Vietnam era but irt
other areas, as well as those whose loved ones dieil consequent to their return from the iar (casuatties of Agent
orange or PTSD-induced suicide), haae expressed great disappointment that tieir lopes ones' name was not on the
Memorial' Such cases haae our deepest sympathy and respect, yet as they do not fit the parameters as described
abooe, these names cannot be added to the Memorial.
Howeaer, The Memorial Fund honors those who haae died as a result of the Vietnam War, but do not meet the
requirements for inclusion on The Wall with its ln Memory program. There is a plaque by the wall to honor these
indfuiduals as well as a ceremony to remember them. Honor Rotl books listing all of the names honored by the
plaque are aaailable to those who participate in the program. Call us at 202-3g3-oogo to learn about the In Memory

Mark,
I found your artide on the website (http://www.locophotogblog.com0 today.It makes me happy that
someone else is paying a tribute to the "107 Missing At Sea-" ",A-bourd NOqZf C,,, I noticed that the site
had used some of my original photos and my own quotes in order for you to make your story known.
I ]P_Preciate that you honored my father's name, George Michael Nau, but failed to mention the other
10 Civilian Crew Members' names; nor, did you give me recognition where it is due.
If you can find thelook, "A Bright Shining Lie" by Neit Sheehan, you can find the other service
member's name who was unable to board N6921c -John paul vann.
Sincerely,
Catherine Nau

and all of these years later I would still like to find where a service was held, or a funeral site.....have
tried to find clues before, come up with nothing. Also, interestingly enough when I did get his service
records from the clearing house in St Louis it doesn't even show he had REenlisted in the Army ......

fighter jet. My father was on this flight as a crewmember and in reseaiching this we confirmed that
this is true.It seems in those days if an American military pilot came across a commercial flight he
would track and simulate attacking €rn enemy aircraft. This time the pilot got carried away and

My father was on this flight and not a day goes by that I do not think about his fate and fellow
passengert and the impact it has had on so many lives. My thoughts and prayers are with all of you
who have followed flight 739, as well as the relatives of the passengers of Maiaysian flight g70 -there
are many of us who know and understand the depth of their grief.

Hello. our family friend Crystal Rider was a stewardess on flight 739.
Is there a list of the crew for the flight?
I went in to the Army in 1963 and went to VN in early 7965.
Thank you.

I, personally, have stood in front of the Califomia Vietnam Veteran's Memorial Commission to
included ALL107 names on the WALL -YEARS AGO. I was redirected to the DoD as they are
the ones who set the criteria for inclusion on the WALL. This has been an uphill battle for 36
years (when I first read the front page article in the L.A. Time s, "707 Missing At Sea,,). One
member of the Commission told me that I could argue that they were o., u 'lsrpport Mission.,,
Also, per the L.A. Timeq their mission was to train the South Vietnamese to defend themselves
against the Communist North Vietnam. According to my letters of correspondence, our flight
WAS inside the CombatZone! You can reference this bysearching the "Broadhead,, case who
argued that his son's plane was outside the CombatZo,ne, so the 6oD "extended the Combat
Zone" to include his sonls narne on the WALL.

We were told at Clark AB that they and-all their equipment was on a C-133 and that was the pla^e
that disappeared and we were looking for.
If and I mean if there were any FTL over the Pacific, I don't believe they were on it, because the
home page under air plane crashes of FTL they only show one FTL flight on3/75/761Lg62.I believe
they were all on the ADAK CRASH and deliberately killed as a false Iag to boost the War

there was a C-133 flight.

I have been thinking back all these years about that time. Here are some facts I remember.
As I mentioned above, we were told it was a C-133 that was famous for dropping out of the sky
and disappearing without a trace over the sea.
If there were 240 Military Special Rangers and all their loaded gear they would have had to be
on a C-133 because there is no way they could have been on a L-1049.
Th"y were on a "secret" mission and would not have been on a Commercial Airlines with
civilians. I remember thatlohn Kennedy was sending 7,500Special forces to train the SVA to
fight their own war in Nam. The L-1049 set on the flilht line in dim lighting at Agana, Guam. A
C-133 would have been at Anderson AFB, Guam anJwould have been loaded with all their
gear and soldiers watched with armed Military Guards for a "Secret" mission. The Stars and
Stripes always under reported the actual count of the dead, anywhere {rom70o/, to 30%.I
believe, thinking about this, that they were transferred to a C-133 and that plane did crash over
the Pacific and the search started when the L-1049 disappeared as a cover. I also believe there
were none on flight as739 if there was such a flight. two rfL flights and only one is mentioned
9l lh" FTL page. The flight 739 mdnot the Adah AK ftight.
I believe the 93 met up with the other 147 atAnderson to complete the 240 alleged that we were
told (maybe prematurely about) and that is the plane that went down. I do not believe a Secret
Mission would have been carried out on a FTL Commercial Flight with non-secure intelligence.
I believe the Standard Oil Ship that had witnesses that could see 500 miles away,was part of
the false flag cover-up along with the Flyrng Tiger Line Personnel. Because right after^that, the
Y"9j, (including the Stars and Stripes) suspected sabotage and even claimed a Russian Missile
had brought the plane down. There were several C-133's that were being moth baled and
replaced by the C-147 and that one of those planes is the one that the 2ft}personnel were on
board.I spent 72 sttai1hthours searching foi them. Their were F-104's ovlr their last reported
location from Clark, Guam and Okinawa and none of them saw anythin&, nor did we.

There is a question if all the troops on board were Rangers or Special Forces. AII I know is I was told
there were 14 guys from my training company on that plane, I would have gone with them but I was
excepted into MI and my orders changed and instead went to Africa.I had 5o auyr leave en route and
got hurt in a horse yreck working cattle at home in Arizona and was about five days late getting to Ft.
Dix learned about the plane being missing from another guy who had been the same training
company' He said the plane had disappeared the day before.I never heard an).more about the plane
until about seven years ago I began wondering about it and ffound flight 7Z9.Tod.ayI found this
website.
